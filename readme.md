This is my second project for my portfolio. It is a fully responsive design made with HTML & CSS. I had to work by copying the design from Figma, which helped me learn a lot. To gain a deeper understanding, I decided to watch a 13-hour [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c26Fyi7RFA&list=PLvq-jIkSeTUbpfewvbKLhHctdkgadAy-K&index=1) by Jon Mircha on how to use this tool while collaborating with others.
